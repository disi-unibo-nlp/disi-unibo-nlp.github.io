        <p class="thesis-desc"><span class="highlight-box">Problem </span><span class="bold-grey">The difficulty in using verbal language, characteristic of autism spectrum disorders and aphasia, constitutes a serious limitation for social and educational integration. In this context, the Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a scientifically recognized method of interpersonal communication that uses pictograms and words to help individuals with cognitive disabilities express their thoughts and needs, supporting linguistic production and comprehension. AAC is now a widespread clinical and domestic practice, where technology has notably found space on portable electronic communicators equipped with touch screens. Displaying panels of pictograms with specific communicative meanings, AAC communicators allow the free composition and reproduction of messages. However, their effectiveness is strongly limited by the challenging management of extensive catalogs of pictograms; ARASAAC, an international standard, has more than 9000 of them. Consequently, anticipating the concepts sought and limiting the pictograms from which to choose is crucial. Training a language model to predict the next pictogram conditionally on those selected up to a certain time point appears to be a natural and highly applicable choice. Importantly, each patient has specific needs: the model should continually learn from the user (stream of selected pictograms) to adapt its behavior and reach personalized suggestions.</span></p>
        <p class="thesis-desc"><span class="highlight-box">What You Will Learn </span><span class="bold-grey">The student will explore continual fine-tuning techniques for large language models targeted at predicting the next pictogram in an AAC framework. Model results will be evaluated both quantitatively (automatic metrics) and qualitatively, with the collaboration of external AAC experts.</span></p>
