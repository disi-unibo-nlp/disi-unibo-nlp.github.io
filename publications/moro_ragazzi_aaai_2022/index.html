  abstract = "The automatic synthesis of biomedical publications catalyzes a profound research interest elicited by literature congestion. Current sequence-to-sequence models mainly rely on the lexical surface and seldom consider the deep semantic interconnections between the entities mentioned in the source document. Such superficiality translates into fabricated, poorly informative, redundant, and near-extractive summaries that severely restrict their real-world application in biomedicine, where the specialized jargon and the convoluted facts further emphasize task complexity. To fill this gap, we argue that the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, exploiting structured and unambiguous representations to capture and conserve the most relevant parts of the text content. This paper presents CogitoErgoSumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization equipping large pre-trained language models with rich semantic graphs. Precisely, we infuse graphs from two complementary semantic parsing techniques with different goals and granularities—Event Extraction and Abstract Meaning Representation, also designing a reward signal to maximize information content preservation through reinforcement learning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the CDSR dataset show that our solution achieves competitive performance according to multiple metrics, despite using 2.5x fewer parameters. Results and ablation studies indicate that our joint text-graph model generates more enlightening, readable, and consistent summaries."

  abstract = "The automatic synthesis of biomedical publications catalyzes a profound research interest elicited by literature congestion. Current sequence-to-sequence models mainly rely on the lexical surface and seldom consider the deep semantic interconnections between the entities mentioned in the source document. Such superficiality translates into fabricated, poorly informative, redundant, and near-extractive summaries that severely restrict their real-world application in biomedicine, where the specialized jargon and the convoluted facts further emphasize task complexity. To fill this gap, we argue that the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, exploiting structured and unambiguous representations to capture and conserve the most relevant parts of the text content. This paper presents CogitoErgoSumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization equipping large pre-trained language models with rich semantic graphs. Precisely, we infuse graphs from two complementary semantic parsing techniques with different goals and granularities—Event Extraction and Abstract Meaning Representation, also designing a reward signal to maximize information content preservation through reinforcement learning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the CDSR dataset show that our solution achieves competitive performance according to multiple metrics, despite using 2.5x fewer parameters. Results and ablation studies indicate that our joint text-graph model generates more enlightening, readable, and consistent summaries."

  abstract = "The latest batch of research has equipped language models with the ability to attend over relevant and factual information from non-parametric external sources, drawing a complementary path to architectural scaling. Besides mastering language, exploiting and contextualizing the latent world knowledge is crucial in complex domains like biomedicine. However, most works in the field rely on general-purpose models supported by databases like Wikipedia and Books. We introduce BioReader, the first retrieval-enhanced text-to-text model for biomedical natural language processing. Our domain-specific T5-based solution augments the input prompt by fetching and assembling relevant scientific literature chunks from a neural database with ≈60 million tokens centered on PubMed. We fine-tune and evaluate BioReader on a broad array of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art methods despite using up to 3x fewer parameters. In tandem with extensive ablation studies, we show that domain knowledge can be easily altered or supplemented to make the model generate correct predictions bypassing the retraining step and thus addressing the literature overload issue."

However, since our ability to generate human-indistinguishable artificial text lags behind our capacity to assess it, it is paramount to develop and apply even better automatic evaluation metrics. To facilitate researchers to judge the effectiveness of their models broadly, we introduce NLG-Metricverse{---}an end-to-end open-source library for NLG evaluation based on Python. Our framework provides a living collection of NLG metrics in a unified and easy-to-use environment, supplying tools to efficiently apply, analyze, compare, and visualize them. This includes (i) the extensive support to heterogeneous automatic metrics with n-arity management, (ii) the meta-evaluation upon individual performance, metric-metric and metric-human correlations, (iii) graphical interpretations for helping humans better gain score intuitions, (iv) formal categorization and convenient documentation to accelerate metrics understanding. NLG-Metricverse aims to increase the comparability and replicability of NLG research, hopefully stimulating new contributions in the area.",

Almost all contributions in the event realm orbit around semantic parsing, usually employing discriminative architectures and cumbersome multi-step pipelines limited to a small number of target interaction types. We present the first lightweight framework to solve both event extraction and event verbalization with a unified text-to-text approach, allowing us to fuse all the resources so far designed for different tasks. To this end, we present a new event graph linearization technique and release highly comprehensive event-text paired datasets, covering more than 150 event types from multiple biology subareas (English language). By streamlining parsing and generation to translations, we propose baseline transformer model results according to multiple biomedical text mining benchmarks and NLG metrics. Our extractive models achieve greater state-of-the-art performance than single-task competitors and show promising capabilities for the controlled generation of coherent natural language utterances from structured data."

  abstract = "Although current state-of-the-art Transformer-based solutions succeeded in a wide range for single-document NLP tasks, they still struggle to address multi-input tasks such as multi-document summarization. Many solutions truncate the inputs, thus ignoring potential summary-relevant contents, which is unacceptable in the medical domain where each information can be vital. Others leverage linear model approximations to apply multi-input concatenation, worsening the results because all information is considered, even if it is conflicting or noisy with respect to a shared background. Despite the importance and social impact of medicine, there are no ad-hoc solutions for multi-document summarization. For this reason, we propose a novel discriminative marginalized probabilistic method (DAMEN) trained to discriminate critical information from a cluster of topic-related medical documents and generate a multi-document summary via token probability marginalization. Results prove we outperform the previous state-of-the-art on a biomedical dataset for multi-document summarization of systematic literature reviews. Moreover, we perform extensive ablation studies to motivate the design choices and prove the importance of each module of our method.",

    abstract = {Abstractive dialogue summarization requires distilling and rephrasing key information from noisy multi-speaker documents. Combining pre-trained language models with input augmentation techniques has recently led to significant research progress. However, existing solutions still struggle to select relevant chat segments, primarily relying on open-domain and unsupervised annotators not tailored to the actual needs of the summarization task. In this paper, we propose DearWatson, a task-aware utterance-level annotation framework for improving the effectiveness and interpretability of pre-trained dialogue summarization models. Precisely, we learn relevant utterances in the source document and mark them with special tags, that then act as supporting evidence for the generated summary. Quantitative experiments are conducted on two datasets made up of real-life messenger conversations. The results show that DearWatson allows model attention to focus on salient tokens, achieving new state-of-the-art results in three evaluation metrics, including semantic and factuality measures. Human evaluation proves the superiority of our solution in semantic consistency and recall. Finally, extensive ablation studies confirm each module’s importance, also exploring different annotation strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large generative language models.}

    abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of multi-modal retrieval of fashion products. State-of-the-art (SOTA) works proposed in literature use vision-and-language transformers to assign similarity scores to joint text-image pairs, then used for sorting the results during a retrieval phase. However, this approach is inefficient since it requires coupling a query with every record in the dataset and computing a forward pass for each sample at runtime, precluding scalability to large-scale datasets. We thus propose a solution that overcomes the above limitation by combining transformers and deep metric learning to create a latent space where texts and images are separately embedded, and their spatial proximity translates into semantic similarity. Our architecture does not use convolutional neural networks to process images, allowing us to test different levels of image-processing details and metric learning losses. We vastly improve retrieval accuracy results on the FashionGen benchmark (+18.71% and +9.22% Rank@1 on Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image, respectively) while being up to 512x faster. Finally, we analyze the speed-up obtainable by different approximate nearest neighbor retrieval strategies—an optimization precluded to current SOTA contributions. We release our solution as a web application available at https://disi-unibo-nlp.github.io/projects/fashion_retrieval/.}

  abstract = {Long document summarization poses obstacles to current generative transformer-based models because of the broad context to process and understand. Indeed, detecting long-range dependencies is still challenging for today&rsquo;s state-of-the-art solutions, usually requiring model expansion at the cost of an unsustainable demand for computing and memory capacities. This paper introduces Emma, a novel efficient memory-enhanced transformer-based architecture. By segmenting a lengthy input into multiple text fragments, our model stores and compares the current chunk with previous ones, gaining the capability to read and comprehend the entire context over the whole document with a fixed amount of GPU memory. This method enables the model to deal with theoretically infinitely long documents, using less than 18 and 13 GB of memory for training and inference, respectively. We conducted extensive performance analyses and demonstrate that Emma achieved competitive results on two datasets of different domains while consuming significantly less GPU memory than competitors do, even in low-resource settings.},

  abstract  = {Infusing structured semantic representations into language models is a rising research trend underpinning many natural language processing tasks that require understanding and reasoning capabilities. Decoupling factual non-ambiguous concept units from the lexical surface holds great potential in abstractive summarization, especially in the biomedical domain, where fact selection and rephrasing are made more difficult by specialized jargon and hard factuality constraints. Nevertheless, current graph-augmented contributions rely on extractive binary relations, failing to model real-world n-ary and nested biomedical interactions mentioned in the text. To alleviate this issue, we present EASumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization empowered by event extraction, namely graph-based representations of relevant medical evidence derived from the source scientific document. By relying on dual text-graph encoders, we prove the promising role of explicit event structures, achieving better or comparable performance than previous state-of-the-art models on the CDSR dataset. We conduct extensive ablation studies, including a wide experimentation of graph representation learning techniques. Finally, we offer some hints to guide future research in the field.}

  abstract = {In knowledge graph representation learning, link prediction is among the most popular and influential tasks. Its surge in popularity has resulted in a panoply of orthogonal embedding-based methods projecting entities and relations into low-dimensional continuous vectors. To further enrich the research space, the community witnessed a prolific development of evaluation benchmarks with a variety of structures and domains. Therefore, researchers and practitioners face an unprecedented challenge in effectively identifying the best solution to their needs. To this end, we propose the most comprehensive and up-to-date study to systematically assess the effectiveness and efficiency of embedding models for knowledge graph completion. We compare 13 models on six datasets with different sizes, domains, and relational properties, covering translational, semantic matching, and neural network-based encoders. A fine-grained evaluation is conducted to compare each technique head-to-head in terms of standard metrics, training and evaluation times, memory consumption, carbon footprint, and space geometry. Our results demonstrate the high dependence between performance and graph types, identifying the best options for each scenario. Among all the encoding strategies, the new generation of translational models emerges as the most promising, bringing out the best and most consistent results across all the datasets and evaluation criteria.},
