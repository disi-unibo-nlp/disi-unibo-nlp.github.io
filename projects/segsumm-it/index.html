<p>The ever-increasing progress of abstractive long document summarization is due to the availability of large-scale public datasets. However, such datasets are mainly in English, limiting and impeding the research advancements in other low-resource languages. In this work, we present a novel large-scale judicial dataset, LAWSU-IT, consisting of 14K Italian legal rulings with expert-written abstractive summaries collected from the Constitutional Court. Compared to existing Italian summarization datasets, LAWSU-IT is the first to have complex long-sized documents and summaries concerning a high social impact domain: the legal one. We train and evaluate extractive and abstractive systems on LAWSU-IT and propose a simple yet effective segmentation-based approach, SegSumm, to summarizing long Italian documents that significantly outperforms the baselines. We hope this study could motivate future directions and promote research over long-range solutions for Italian text summarization.</p>
